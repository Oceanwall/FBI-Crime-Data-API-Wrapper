# FBI (Uniform) Crime Data API Wrapper

Minimalist FBI Uniform Crime Data (UCR) API Wrapper, meant primarily for personal use with a future project, but shared publicly so that others can also use it.

Fulfills most if not all of the functionality indicated by the [FBI uniform crime data API found here](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api). Also extends some additional functionality that might be helpful.

## Basic Usage

```
require('dotenv').config();

const FBI_Wrapper = require("fbi-ucr-api");
let wrapper = new FBI_Wrapper(process.env.API_KEY);

wrapper.getVictimsByORI("MI2802800", "burglary", "age").then((results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
wrapper.getCrimeCountByRegion("West", "aggravated-assault").then((results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
wrapper.getVictimsByState("TX", "burglary", "age").then((results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
```

Additional examples for how to use these methods can be found in examples/index.js.

For information about how to use a .env file, see [documentation for dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

## Testing

```
npm test
```

This command checks the intended return types of all methods versus their actual return types to ensure that they are returning the correct type of information.

**Note:** Running all of the tests may take a significant amount of time (between 1-2 minutes) due to all of the GET requests made by the API wrapper.

## Additional Remarks

To understand the data provided by this API wrapper, it can be helpful to look at other projects that have used this data. One such (official US Government) project is the FBI's [crime data explorer](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api), which visualizes this information.

[Find this package on npm here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fbi-ucr-api).

This API wrapper is licensed under the MIT License. Feel free to fork this repo and make whatever edits you want to the wrapper.

Do not expect maintenance.

<!--
TODO LIST:
(x) Complete all default methods
(x) Document all default methods
(x) Change return types (from Promise -> Object to Promise -> Array for that which can be isolated)
(x) Write test cases for all default methods
( ) Come up with extra methods that extend functionality
( ) Document all methods
( ) Write test cases for all methods
( ) Error checking for all methods (check parameters? ensure correct typing?)
( ) TODO ^ Abstract out into error checking function?
( ) Error checking test cases for all methods
( ) Mention known bug (dataset server down, not returning info)

New custom methods include:

getCrimeByORI
getMultipleCrimesByOri
getAgenciesByRegion
getAgenciesByCoordinates
getAllStates
getStatesByRegion

get information by year range? (victims, offenders, crime statistics)
possibly take state ids (in addition to abbreviations?)

there has got to be a better way to do the error handler smh

NOTE: removed error handling toggling (REMOVE potential for USER ERROR, WE OPINIONATED NOW BOYS)
TODO: remove errors from fbi wrapper area?
